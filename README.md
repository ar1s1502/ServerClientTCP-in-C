**TO USE:**
Have two terminal tabs open. Run  `./server` on one first, then run `./client1` from the other terminal. Enter commands from client terminal. 

Sometimes after exiting the connection will fail; wait a couple seconds before re-running programs to ensure that the connection works.

To compile the the server.c program, run 
```
gcc server.c serv_functions.c -o server
```
